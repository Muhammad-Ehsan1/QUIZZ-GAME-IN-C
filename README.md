# QUIZZ-GAME-IN-C
Developed a quiz game using the C programming language where a question is displayed, and the user must provide an answer. A correct answer earns 5 marks, while an incorrect answer results in 0 marks. This project demonstrates the use of control structures, user input handling, and basic scoring mechanisms in C.
